### To create a classification system which detects how healthy a hip joints are with the help of x-ray images and specifies whether the hip joints are normal or not.

• Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.

• To show on the optical viewfinder of the camera module whether a hip joints healthy or not.

• A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects     from one another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.

• Today, each and every system is being automated. There is much less human intervention as it is both time consuming and non-economical. For the defect     identification purposes, automated systems are used. The image processing has been widely used for identification, classification and quality evaluation.

• Neural networks and machine learning have been used for these tasks and have obtained good results.

### Clone Yolov7

• More about Yolov7 :- https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7

• Google Colab And Roboflow is used. train your model on colab and download the weights and pass them into yolov7 folder.

### FUTURE SCOPE

• As we know technology is marching towards automation so this project is one of the step towards automation.

• Thus, for more accurate results it needs to be trained for more images, and for a greater number of epochs.
